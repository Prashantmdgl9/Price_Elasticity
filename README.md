# Price_Elasticity
Price Elasticity Examination for the avocadoes.

In the present work I examine three questions:

1. Is there a relation between demand and supply of avocados over the time?
2. What is the price elasticity of demand for avocado?
3. Is the price dependent only on the demand or there are other factors too?


## Data
There are three columns which Avocado aficionados will be aware of:
4046 - Small/Medium Hass Avocado (~3–5oz avocado)
4225 - Large Hass Avocado (~8–10oz avocado) 
4770 - Extra Large Hass Avocado (~10–15oz avocado)
